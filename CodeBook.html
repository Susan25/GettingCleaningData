<h3>Codebook for Human Activity Recognition Tidy dataset</h3>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>This data contains a summarization of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, available from:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones</a></p>

<p>The experiment was conducted by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, et. al.,  (<a href="mailto:activityrecognition@smartlab.ws">activityrecognition@smartlab.ws</a>). A description of the experiment as described in their data set is summarized below: </p>

<p>The original data was the result of an experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear accleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. </p>

<p>The features selected from the original dataset come from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. The time domain signals (prefixed by &ldquo;Time&rdquo;) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. They were then filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. The acceleration signals were separated into body and gravity acceleration signals(Time Body Accelerator XYZ and Time Gravity Accelerator XYZ) using anotherlow pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.</p>

<p>The body linear accleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (Time Body Acceleration Jerk XYZ and Time Body Gyro Jerk XYZ). Also, the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (Time Body Acceleration Mag, Time Gravity Accleration Mag, Time Body Acceleration Jerk Mag, Time Body Gyro Mag, Time Body Gyro Jerk Mag).</p>

<p>A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing the variables prefixed by &ldquo;Freq&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The original data sets were segmented into training and testing files. Additionally, information about the subject (subject number) and activity (activity number) were separated.</p>

<p>Using these original data sets, the training and Testing data was combined into one data set. A subset of the measurements was obtained by extracting only the mean and standard deviation measuremetns. The resulting data was then summarized by averaging by study participant and activity undertaken during the experiment. The resulting data can be found in this repo in the R data frame &ldquo;HumanActivityRecognition_Tidy&rdquo;. See the README for more information.</p>
